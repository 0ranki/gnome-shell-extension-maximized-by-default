### Maximized by Default GNOME shell extension

Forked from https://github.com/aXe1/gnome-shell-extension-maximized-by-default

#### NOT working well yet
There are issues on dual monitors, some windows start larger than the current monitor.

Start all windows maximized by default. Useful for those of us utilizing workspaces heavily.

Only maximizes windows that are marked to support it, e.g. dialogs are not maximized.
